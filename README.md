# tunnelrunner
ASCII school-project game (2007)
Game and source in Finnish
The EXE file can be run with DosBox
The source file contains no colour, although it is there in the precompiled EXE file, my teacher at the time wouldn't allow it for some technical reason and I've lost the alternative source file
If you wanted to compile this, the one I used originally was Borland C++ 3.1 in DOS

This game is an ASCII dungeon crawler. The rooms are RNG generated, slightly bigger each time. Reaching level 10 is the goal. You must reach the end of the level until your "turn count" reaches 0. Should it reach 0, it will activate sudden death mode where you can still try to reach the end.
There are 
$${\color{orange}%}$$ bombs you can create holes in the walls with, 
$${\color{white}&}$$ skeleton soldiers who will drastically lower your "round count" on contact, but they will vanish after a few rounds should you escape them
$${\color{blue}~}$$ map items to show you the layout of the level for a second and 
$${\color{yellow}$}$$ treasure for extrapoints

Controls W, A, S, D, 
big-Q for exiting,
r for detonating a wall (press any button to skip the instrucition, then choose direction to detonate WASD)
? is finnish instructions during the game

I just wanted to save this for my future self, maybe you can have some fun looking at the legacy stuff.
